Deliver is a pure bash deployment tool with virtually no dependencies.
It only cares about having enough info in the shell environment to do
its job. Why add Ruby or Python wrappers on top of system commands when
bash was built for this?

Capistrano was just infuriating when you added rvm and bundler into the
mix, git-deploy is great for single server, but what if you're running a
bunch of auto-scaled clusters (Ruby, node.js etc.)?

Delivering a nodejs service to multiple hosts:

![deliver nodejs service to multiple hosts][2]

Delivering deliver to [github:pages][8] (very inception-esque):

![deliver deliver to github:pages][7]

Strategies is what sets this utility apart from everything else. By
default, it comes with strategies for:

  * [ruby][3]

  * [nodejs][4]

  * [gh-pages][5]

  * [generated][10]

  * [s3][11]

You can also add your own, project-specific strategies, or customise
existing ones. [Read more about deliver strategies.][6]


## 1 INSTALLATION

### 1.1 Check out deliver into `~/.deliver`.

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/videomonkey/deliver.git ~/.deliver
```

### 1.2 Add `~/.deliver/bin` to your `$PATH` for access to the `deliver` command-line utility

```bash
$ echo 'export PATH="${PATH}:$HOME/.deliver/bin"' >> ~/.bash_profile
# if using zsh
$ echo 'export PATH="${PATH}:$HOME/.deliver/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### 1.3 Source your shell profile

```bash
$ . ~/.bash_profile
# if using zsh
$ . ~/.zshrc 
```

### 1.4 Personalize

There are no generators or initializers, you will need to manually create a
`.deliver/config` file in the app's root folder that you want to deliver.

This is a good example:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

APP="events"
HOSTS="ruby-1,ruby-2"
PORT="5000"
```



## 2 USAGE

From the root of your project, run:

```bash
$ deliver check
```

![deliver check][9]

This will print the most important config settings and ensure that
deliver has everything that it needs for a successful run. 

Deliver will use the ruby strategy by default. If you want to use a different
one, specify it in your `.deliver/config` file.

To see a list of available strategies:

```bash
$ deliver strategies

Deliver started at [GoSquared][1]. It was a place where each of us was
free to use their own programming language. As long as the service
exposed an API and had decent test coverage, anything went. Yes,
**even** PHP.



## INSPIRATION

"Rather than fitting a large number of complex primitives, choose a small
number of simple primitives that can be combined in an infinite way to
produce complex results. What was left out is more important than what
was put in." [AT&T - the UNIX operating system][att_unix]
